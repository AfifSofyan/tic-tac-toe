This is a tic-tac-toe game project to complete Cisco Networking Academy Python Basic-Intermediate Course

This game is not an AI project
It means the computer is not going to take user's choice into consideration when making moves
The computer is not building strategy to win as well

In the other words:
If you fail to win this simple game
Then I have nothing left to say
